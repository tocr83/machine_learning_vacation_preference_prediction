# machine_learning_vacation_preference_prediction

The project aims to model vacation preference. The project initially first encodes nominal and ordinal data using sklearn.

It sets up 10 different binary classification models that aims to predict with accuracy the test data.

As the target variable in the dataset is imbalanced, we also examine the precision-recall tradeoff at various threshold settings of the classifier.
